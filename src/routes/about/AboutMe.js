      My name is Michelle Dagsa, a 22-year-old 4th-year college student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I live in the scenic municipality of Cagwait in Surigao del Sur, known for its pristine beaches and vibrant culture. I am passionate about cooking and enjoy experimenting with new recipes that bring out unique flavors. I love exploring new things, whether itâ€™s learning innovative technologies, trying different hobbies, or meeting people from diverse backgrounds. Traveling is one of my greatest joys, as it allows me to discover breathtaking destinations, immerse myself in various cultures, and create unforgettable memories.
